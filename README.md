 strobe lights with Arduino and C#
Use transistors to control the voltage of 12V LEDs, for example. This project is for a 3-color LED strip. The control signals go to the transistors. I recommend the "IRZ44N" ones, which are compatible with PWM.

This code is in C# and uses Windows Form, but it doesn't create a window, it's more convenient this way.
